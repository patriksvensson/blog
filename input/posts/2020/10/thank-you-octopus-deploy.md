When I started working on Cake in 2014, I did it to scratch an itch I had. [FAKE](https://fake.build/) existed (which has been a tremendous initial inspiration), but I didn't know F# enough (at all) to be confident enough to bet our build process on it.

A lot has happened since then; .NET has changed, and so has Cake. We've moved from a separate _Roslyn_ and _Mono_ engine to a unified one based on _Roslyn_. We've added support for _C# 6_, _7_, _8_, and just recently _9_. In addition to _.NET Framework_, we've added support for every version of _.NET Core_, from the early beta to .NET 5. The project has also gone from a single maintainer to nine, which I think is the biggest reason for its success.

We keep a close eye on statistics. Not only is it satisfying seeing the numbers go up, but it's also an indicator that people and companies still use our little project. Cake in its different incarnations has been downloaded over 12 million times and is the [third most downloaded dotnet tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages?packagetype=dotnettool&sortby=totalDownloads-desc&q=&prerel=True) on _NuGet_. Build tools don't often get credit as libraries do, but we know that some big companies like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) use Cake in their build process. However, no company has ever reached out to us about [sponsoring us](https://opencollective.com/cake) in any way. That is until a couple of weeks ago.

## Getting our first sponsor

Out of the blue, [Paul Stovell](https://paulstovell.com/), the founder of [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/), reached out to me and wondered if we would let them become an official Cake sponsor! I'm personally a big fan of _Octopus Deploy_, a tool that I've been using a lot throughout my career, and I must confess I was very humbled that such a great company wanted to sponsor our little project.

We've always worked on Cake in our free time, but having sponsors opens up for so many things. Suddenly, we can put even more time into the project, and we can hire external services for things that we sometimes don't have the experience or knowledge about ourselves. 

I'm not saying that your company should sponsor Cake, but you should take a moment, reflect on what projects you depend on, [and try to make sure that those projects stay around](https://opencollective.com/cake).

## Summary

To put it short, companies like _Octopus Deploy_, that sponsor projects that they depend on, **make open source sustainable**, and I want to say a personal **thank you** to them for doing it!
